      <p class="secondary_color text-lg text-justify w-2/3">
        Driver fatigue and inattentiveness are significant contributors to road accidents worldwide, leading to injuries, fatalities, and substantial economic losses. Traditional methods to combat driver fatigue, such as rest breaks and caffeine, are often insufficient, particularly during long or monotonous drives. Current systems, such as warning beeps, are often ignored or quickly dismissed by drivers. <br /><br />

        <span class="header_color font-semibold">Secure Co-Pilot</span> is an AI-powered assistant designed to enhance driver safety and engagement during journeys. It monitors the driver for drowsiness and fatigue, alerting them with a personalized voice from a loved one. To keep the driver awake and alert, the assistant engages in discussions about news and various topics and supports casual conversations. It further supports multiple languages, and ensures adherence to various safety protocols like seat belt use, phone avoidance etc. In emergencies, it can alert nearby police and rescue teams, ensuring immediate assistance.
